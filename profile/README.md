# The Eureka ESR Project

Eureka is a theme originally created by WANG Chucheng, but appears to have been abandoned. By forking the theme and its related projects, we aim to bring this beautiful theme back to life.

## Goal of this organization

The goal is first and foremost to keep the Eureka theme available and compatible with the latest Hugo versions as they are released. The theme should be a drop-in replacement for people switching from the original theme with little to no visual changes.

* **Helping with any of the ["help wanted" issues](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=org%3Ahugo-eureka-esr+label%3A%22help+wanted%22&s=created&type=issues)!** 
* Bug fixes
* Upgrading dependencies
* Fixing typos
* Improving documentation

**New features are also welcome**, but please keep the goal mentioned above in mind.
